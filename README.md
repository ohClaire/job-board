### Timeframe
* Estimated 30 hours

# Overview 
In this challenge, I chose to recreate Option 2 from the [project spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html) to practice our HTML and CSS. The goal wa to recreate the comp that best reflect's the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color. However,  I was given some creative license with color choices, picture and text content and the option to use different assets where I was unable to find a close match.

# Lessons Learned
The overall layout for this page was more complicated than I anticipated. I spent majority of my time building out the HTML skeleton. I had a lot planned for the dashboard but was not able to apply all the features so it ended up being unfinished. I ended up spending more time on styling the buttons and icons than I anticipated. I used Chart.js documentation to create the doubhnut charts and bar chart. I also learned how to create a table in HTML. I wish I had used Project Board to plan this project to have a better estimate for the features I wanted to include.

# Future Features
* Create a Project Board
* Add styling to Table to better reflect comp
* DRY up the CSS
* Add responsiveness with breakpoints for screen size
* Improve accessibility
* Pass WAVE tests
* Continue to explore aria to make the page more accessible
